flip-flap
=========

Description
--
This project consist to develop a virtual flip flap display which can be added into a web page and displayed into webgl enabled browsers. This kind of displays may be seen on train stations and airport. 
This is a totally personal project to practice and apply what I learnt from [learning webgl](http://learningwebgl.com/blog/ "Learning WebGL") and the Functional Inherithance Pattern from D. Crockford's book : Javascript : The Good parts.

A similar project has been developed by Spite and is describe [here](http://www.clicktorelease.com/blog/split-flap-display). Nevertheless, this project is based on CSS3D and is not related with mine.


Constraints
--
- Use pure __webGL__ API (no frameworks such as Three.js) to become familiar with it
- Use __requireJS__ to modularize the project
- Use Douglas Crockford's _Functional Inheritance__ pattern to test it
- bonus1 : use the common _Prototypal Inheritance__ pattern and compare code and perfs with the functional one
