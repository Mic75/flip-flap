<div class="project">
<h1>splip-flap</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This project consists in developing a virtual split-flap display which can be added into a web page and displayed into webgl enabled browsers. 
  This kind of displays may be seen on train stations and airports. 
  This is a totally personal project to practice and apply what I learnt from <a href="http://learningwebgl.com/blog/">learning webgl</a> 
  and the Functional Inherithance Pattern from D. Crockford's book,  Javascript : The Good parts.</p>

<p>A similar project has been developed by Spite and is described <a href="http://www.clicktorelease.com/blog/split-flap-display">here</a>. 
Nevertheless, this project is based on CSS3D and is not related to mine.</p>


<h2>Constraints</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use pure <strong>webGL</strong> API (no frameworks such as Three.js) to become familiar with it</li>
  <li>Use <strong>requireJS</strong> to modularize the project</li>
  <li>Use Douglas Crockford's <em>Functional Inheritance</em> pattern to test it</li>
  <li>bonus1 : use the common <em>Prototypal Inheritance</em> pattern and compare code and perfs with the functional one</li>
</ul>
