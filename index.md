splip-flap
=========

Description
--
This project consists in developing a virtual split-flap display which can be added into a web page and displayed into webgl enabled browsers. This kind of displays may be seen on train stations and airports. 
This is a totally personal project to practice and apply what I learnt from [learning webgl](http://learningwebgl.com/blog/ "Learning WebGL") and the Functional Inherithance Pattern from D. Crockford's book,  Javascript : The Good parts.

A similar project has been developed by Spite and is described [here](http://www.clicktorelease.com/blog/split-flap-display "ClickToRelease"). Nevertheless, this project is based on CSS3D and is not related to mine.

Try the [demo]({{ site.baseurl }}/demo/demo.html) !

Constraints
--
- Use pure webGL API (no frameworks such as Three.js) to become familiar with it
- Use requireJS to modularize the project
- Use Douglas Crockford's _Functional Inheritance_ pattern to test it
- bonus1 : use the common _Prototypal Inheritance_ pattern and compare code and perfs with the functional one
